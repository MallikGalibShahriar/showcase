    description: `Clickjacking is a type of cyber attack where a malicious website or element tricks you into clicking on something different from what you actually see. It's like someone hiding a button behind a picture and when you try to click on the picture, you're actually clicking the hidden button. This can be used to make you unintentionally perform actions like sharing sensitive information, liking a post, or even giving access to your device. It's important to be cautious and only click on things from sources you trust.`,
